Bitcoin Price Surges to $65K Ahead of $5.8B Options Expiry

Bitcoin has traded above $65000 for the first time in four weeks, touching $65687 at 3.7% gain. This surge comes just ahead of the expiry of over $5.8 billion in options contracts that some analysts have said could cause more volatility in the market. 

Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, pointed out that this price has been a resistance level for Bitcoin in August and September. “We’re retesting it,” he said, stressing that a breakout could lead to a rally, while a breakdown below $65,000 could lead to a selloff. 

Analyzing the Bitcoin Options Expiry
About 20% of the Bitcoin contracts are in the money as traders prepare for the options expiration on Friday. Deribit’s CEO, Luuk Strijers, said that such a large expiry could impact the market since traders will be rebalancing their trades.

Darius Tabai, the CEO of Vertex, said, “The market should chop around ahead of expiries as gamma hedging takes control of the market around the 60 and 65k levels.” There are talks about regulation since many investors await clearer rules to improve the market's stability. 

What’s Behind Bitcoin’s Push Toward $70,000?

Market analysts believe several key factors drive Bitcoin’s upward momentum, which could help 

it push past $65,000 and head toward $70,000. One of the biggest drivers is the current macroeconomic environment. As the US interest rates remain low, borrowing money is cheaper, encouraging investment in riskier assets like Bitcoin. 

Institutional Investors Are Back In The Game
Over just two days, $242 million flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs, financial products that allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying and storing it themselves. This shift in institutional demand is particularly notable because earlier this year, there was skepticism about whether these large players would fully embrace Bitcoin.

For example, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched in late August, saw only $5 million in inflows during its first few weeks. But now, sentiment seems to be changing, and institutional investors are starting to see Bitcoin as a more stable and attractive investment.

The Role Of Tech Stocks And Investor Confidence
The tech sector has played a significant role in boosting global stock markets, which has a ripple effect on Bitcoin. Over the last six months, several major tech companies, including:

Alibaba
Tesla
Nvidia
Taiwan Semiconductor
Apple
They have seen their stock prices rise by more than 30%. This strong performance has given investors more confidence in the market, contributing to Bitcoin’s rally. 

Michael Matousek, head trader at US Global Investors, pointed out that while artificial intelligence (AI) remains a significant trend, the excitement around AI might have been overhyped in the short term. The long-term growth potential of AI, particularly in sectors like chip manufacturing, is still strong. This optimism has supported the broader tech market, which has helped drive demand for assets like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s Connection to Global Money Supply
Another interesting factor to consider is Bitcoin’s correlation with the global monetary base, also known as the M2 money supply. Lyn Alden, a well-known investment researcher, recently highlighted that Bitcoin is closely tied to changes in the amount of money circulating in the global economy. 

Bitcoin’s price has increased by 83% in cases when more money is added to the financial system. This is especially important as governments worldwide are once again starting to inject liquidity into their economies following a long pause. Stimulus measures that pump more money into the economy often lead to inflation, and Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold in previous decades. Bitcoin has outperformed gold in its correlation to the monetary base, making it an attractive option for those looking to protect their wealth. 

What’s Next for Bitcoin? 
With Bitcoin back above $65,000, many are wondering what will happen next. Strong macroeconomic trends, rising institutional demand, and a booming tech sector could all continue to fuel Bitcoin's rise toward $70,000. However, it is important to remember that Bitcoin is still volatile, and sudden price swings are always possible.

The growing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest that investor confidence is increasing. As more institutions move into the space, Bitcoin is viewed as less risky, and this shift in sentiment could create the perfect conditions for a rally to $70,000 and beyond.
