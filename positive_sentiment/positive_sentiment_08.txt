Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC To $200K? Why Whales Are Bullish on Bitcoin and JetBolt

Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a hot streak recently, effortlessly surpassing milestones as if they were mere road bumps. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at an impressive $98,971.01, after reaching an all-time high of $99,486.10, rising nearly 3% in just 24 hours. This staggering rally is sparking murmurs among crypto insiders that the dream of Bitcoin reaching $100K is no longer a question of “if” but “when.” 

Meanwhile, new altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is heating up the blockchain space with its zero-gas technology and other Web3 innovations. JetBolt’s presale has surged past 66 million tokens sold—a highly impressive feat for a young altcoin. 

If Bitcoin could hit $100K, can BTC push for $200K? And what’s driving crypto whales to be bullish on Bitcoin and JetBolt? Let’s explore further. 

Bitcoin: Is $200K ambitious for digital gold BTC?
Bitcoin (BTC), the first cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology, has been hailed as the “digital gold” of the crypto economy. BTC surged past $99,000 for the first time over the past 24 hours, before slightly dropping to its current price of $98,971.01. Bitcoin’s trading volume reached $104.70 billion and its market cap stands at $1.96 trillion.

Bitcoin’s series of notable surges can be traced back to the victory of Donald Trump who vowed to make the US “the crypto capital of the world.” With optimism about more crypto-friendly policies under Trump, Bitcoin began rallying. BTC doubled its value and climbed a jaw-dropping 40% rise in the last two weeks alone. 

Bitcoin-focused spot ETFs in the U.S. have experienced a rise in institutional investment, with over $4 billion flowing into these funds since the election. On November 20th, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs marked their third consecutive day of inflows, attracting $773.47 million. In total, the funds have seen more than $1.8 billion in inflows over the last three trading days, according to CoinGlass data.

This level of activity signals a growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin. Analysts say that BTC ETF inflows must continue at their current pace. If long-term holders begin selling off and ETF buying slows down, the market could experience some turbulence. 

Nevertheless, the bullish momentum remains strong, and BTC could easily break through $100K at any time. But could Bitcoin push further to $200K? Analysts suggest this may happen in the near future if BTC could sustain its upward trajectory and favorable factors remain, as per BTC’s current dynamics.

JetBolt: Attracting crypto whales with its zero-gas technology 
As Bitcoin marks new milestones, JetBolt (JBOLT), a rising altcoin, is taking the blockchain space by storm. Following a successful presale of over 66 million tokens, this innovative cryptocurrency is set to redefine the Web3 experience. 

To begin with, JetBolt’s groundbreaking zero-gas technology, powered by the Skale Network,  eliminates costly gas fees. This positively impacts blockchain users and developers by making transactions faster and more cost-efficient.
